I use it for checking my heart rate and I installed golf app very useful. when i’m on golf course i can answer phone or dismiss play music check weather and answer endless questions from my buddy what time is it. better than phone because i can lose phone on golf course but watch always on my hand.",

They have an excellent return policy. Once we started communicating, it was the smoothest customer service experience I ever had!",

The seller listed it as refurbished in excellent condition. Although it came in a generic box, the phone looks brand new -not a scratch- and works perfectly. Good value. I would recommend this seller for sure.",
