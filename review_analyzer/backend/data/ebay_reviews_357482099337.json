    "text": "HELLO WORLD I AM WRITING THIS REVIEW TO YOU ON MY BRAND NEW USED IPHONE 16!!!! guys i’m so excited i’m the cow that jumps over the moon. the phone is stunning. one tiny scratch on the screen that I can’t even see while the screen is on, and it honestly took me a while to even find it. I messaged the seller and asked for one with 100% battery capacity and a low charge cycle, and while they said they wouldn’t be able to guarantee that it’s still what I got!! for less than $700 you can’t beat this!",

It unfortunately came with some scratches on the screen when it is supposed to be in excellent condition (reason why I put 4 stars.) \nSeller offered a partial refund and I keep the phone or just return for a full refund. I wasn’t too bothered with the scratches so I just took the partial refund. Would recommend!",
