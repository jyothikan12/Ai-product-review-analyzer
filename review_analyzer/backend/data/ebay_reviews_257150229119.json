    "text": "This is the 3rd phone we have bought from this seller! All of the phones we have ever purchased including this one was in better condition than described! Why pay $1200 for a phone you can get for $200 or less??  Shipping was done through FedEx and it came  in 2-3 days!! The phones was packed in a nice box so it wouldn't be damaged in transport and it even came with a new charger and wall plug.  We will definitely buy from this seller again and have saved him as a trusted seller on our account.",

I contacted the seller and they replied in less than 24 hours. I submitted the return request and had a return label in less than 24 hours and a credit was applied to my account as soon as they got the earbuds back. Top notch customer service.

I'm very happy with the condition of the device. Also, the seller sent the item lightning fast. I ordered on Thursday and it was delivered on Saturday. That's basically Amazon speed. And lastly the price was unbeatable. I've seen other items with less qualify, for higher prices. I def recommend buying from this seller. 5 stars!",
