Appearance, again, depends on whether or not you think $200 is worth the quality of what you get. It has scuffs on the bezel and the body of the watch.",

Why pay $1200 for a phone you can get for $200 or less??  Shipping was done through FedEx and it came  in 2-3 days!! The phones was packed in a nice box so it wouldn't be damaged in transport and it even came with a new charger and wall plug.  We will definitely buy from this seller again and have saved him as a trusted seller on our account.",
